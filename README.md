# Waiter-Tips-Prediction-With-Machine-Learning-Using-Python

# Introduction
The dataset provided captures detailed information from restaurant transactions, including attributes such as the total bill, tip amount, gender of the payer, smoking status, day of the week, time of the meal, and party size. This data offers valuable insights into dining habits, allowing for analysis of tipping behavior and its correlation with various factors.

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the tip amount a waiter can expect to receive based on the available features in the dataset. By utilizing machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a reliable tool that can assist in optimizing service quality and maximizing tip earnings for waitstaff.

# Dataset
The dataset encompasses the following columns:

1. **total_bill**: The total bill amount for the meal.
2. **tip**: The tip amount left by the customer.
3. **sex**: The gender of the payer (Male or Female).
4. **smoker**: Indicates whether the party included smokers (Yes or No).
5. **day**: The day of the week when the meal occurred (e.g., Sun for Sunday).
6. **time**: Indicates if the meal was served during lunch or dinner.
7. **size**: The size of the party dining.
